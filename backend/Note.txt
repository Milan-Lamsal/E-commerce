###  Server & Backend Core

1. `express`
   → A fast, minimal web framework for Node.js used to build web apps and APIs.
    Helps handle routing, middleware, requests, and responses easily.

2. `cors`
   → Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing so your backend can communicate with frontend apps hosted on different domains or ports.
    Solves CORS errors in frontend-backend communication.

3. `dotenv`
   → Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
    Keeps API keys and secrets safe and out of your code.

###  Security & Authentication

4. `jsonwebtoken` (JWT)
   → Helps create and verify JWT tokens, used in authentication.
    Useful for login systems (e.g., sending a token after login and validating it later).

5. `bcrypt`
   → A hashing library for encrypting passwords before storing them in the database.
    Ensures stored passwords are secure.

---

###  Database

6. `mongoose` (You wrote "mangoose", which is a typo)
   → An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
    Helps you interact with MongoDB in an object-oriented way using schemas and models.

###  File Upload

7. `multer`
   → Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used for file uploads.
    For uploading images, documents, etc., to your server or cloud storage.

---

###  Payment Gateways

8. `razorpay`
   → SDK for integrating Razorpay payment gateway in your Node.js backend.
    Used for handling payments (mostly used in India).

9. `stripe`
   → SDK for integrating Stripe, a global payment processor.
    Also used for payment handling, subscriptions, invoicing, etc.

###  Data Validation

10. `validator`
    → A library of string validators and sanitizers.
     Validates emails, URLs, passwords, etc., on the backend.

---

###  Media Storage

11. `cloudinary`
    → SDK for uploading and managing media (images, videos) on Cloudinary’s cloud platform.
     Makes image upload, transformation, and delivery easy.

---

While creating an MongoDB database then don't use the "@" in passwords otherwise you
 wil get error

 1. validator
Library for validating and sanitizing strings (like emails, passwords, phone numbers, etc.)

2. bcrypt
Library for hashing and comparing passwords securely

Plaintext passwords are dangerous to store — bcrypt turns them into secure hashes.

For example:

Original Password	Hashed Password (example)
mypassword123	$2b$10$4GzRgN1yrA1o4A7OL8Q0LeZ...
